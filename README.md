WARN ACT California Dashboard
Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN)
WARN Act - Overview WARN protects employees, their families, and communities by requiring employers to give a 60-day notice to the affected employees and both state and local representatives before a plant closing or mass layoff.
Advance notice provides employees and their families time to transition and adjust to the potential loss of employment, time to seek alternative jobs and, if necessary, time to obtain skills training or retraining to successfully 
compete in the job market.
